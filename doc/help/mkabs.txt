  Converts relative links beginning with / to absolute URLs; when the --greedy
  option is given links beginning with # and ? are also made absolute.  When no --base URL is given and a package.json file is available in the
  current working directory the base URL is extracted from the repository URL
  in package.json and the --relative path when not set assumes a github
  repository using the /blob/master path.

Options
  -b, --base=[URL]        Base URL for absolute links
  -r, --relative=[PATH]   Relative path when repository url
  -g, --greedy            Convert links starting with # and ?
  -h, --help              Display help and exit
  --version               Print the version and exit
